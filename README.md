# Build a Complete Responsive Collaborative Task Management System | HTML & CSS & Javascript | 

We will build a two-pages task management system. We will work intensively with HTML & CSS. And we are going to use Javascript as well to add some user interactions. What we will accomplish together:

⚙️ Build login/signup page

⚙️ Build dashboard page

⚙️ Display tasks in two different ways: list & board views

⚙️ Build popups: add task & view task popups

⚙️ Build a design system using CSS custom properties

⚙️ Construct fully responsive pages

⚙️ Show/hide elements

⚙️ Show feedback notifications
